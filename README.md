# Flash cards

App for creating and reviewing flash cards and adding them to sets.

Made with React, Typescript, Vite, Vitest, Playwright.

Backend used for this is my [flash-cards-backend](https://github.com/kmsolomon/flash-cards-backend) repo.
The backend is in a separate repo because I intend to try out other non-React frontends with it eventually.
